# fullstack-fall2020-kanban
A group project created as part of the Full Stack programming course, Fall 2020.  The project is a web-based organizational tool,
in the vein of a multi-column Kanban Board, in which users may create new projects (individually or in groups), add/delete tasks,
and drag/drop tasks between columns depending upon progress.  Also includes an embedded Google Calendar.  The application is supported
by a SQL back-end, which maintains users, projects, and associated tasks.  Languages used include HTML, CSS, Javascript and PHP.

# Unit Testing
